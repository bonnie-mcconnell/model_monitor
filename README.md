# Model Monitor

A production-style **model monitoring & retraining system** that simulates real-world ML inference, drift detection, metrics tracking, and automated retraining with promotion logic.

This project is intentionally designed to mirror how **real ML platforms** (internal tools at companies like Stripe, Uber, or Canva) monitor models in production — not toy notebooks.

---

## ✨ What This Project Demonstrates

* **Online inference simulation** with delayed labels
* **Feature drift detection** using Population Stability Index (PSI)
* **Rolling metrics tracking** (accuracy, F1, confidence)
* **Persistent metrics history** for auditability
* **Automated retraining triggers** based on drift + performance
* **Model comparison & promotion logic**
* **Production-style FastAPI service** with health & readiness probes
* **Clear separation of concerns** (inference, monitoring, training, API)

This is a *systems* project, not just a model.

## 🔁 Streaming & Retraining Logic

1. Batches are generated and passed to the predictor
2. Labels arrive **with delay** (simulating real systems)
3. Metrics are updated once labels resolve
4. PSI drift is computed on a rolling window
5. Retraining is triggered if:

   * Drift exceeds threshold **and**
   * Accuracy falls below minimum
6. Candidate model is trained and evaluated
7. Candidate is promoted only if improvement exceeds threshold

All decisions are **logged and persisted**.

---

## 🌡 Health & Readiness

* `GET /health` → process liveness
* `GET /ready` → model artifact existence & loadability

These endpoints are designed to work with container orchestration systems.

---

## 📊 Metrics API

Example response from `/metrics/latest`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1734829012.2,
  "batch_id": "batch_17_a3f1c9",
  "accuracy": 0.81,
  "f1": 0.79,
  "avg_confidence": 0.72,
  "drift_score": 0.26,
  "action": "retrain",
  "reason": "psi_threshold_exceeded"
}
```

---

## 🖥 Optional UI (Phase 9B)

A minimal Streamlit dashboard can be layered on top of the API to visualize:

* Accuracy / F1 over time
* Drift score trend
* Retraining events

This UI is intentionally thin — the **core value is the backend system**.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Most ML portfolios stop at training a model.

This project shows:

* you understand **model lifecycle management**
* you can build **robust, inspectable systems**
* you think like an ML engineer, not a notebook user

This is the kind of project that gets *follow-up questions* in interviews.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python training/train.py
python scripts/run_simulation.py
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

---

## 🧩 Future Extensions (Optional)

* Model versioning metadata
* Canary deployments
* Alerting hooks (Slack / email)
* Offline evaluation reports

---

Built to be **clear, realistic, and production-minded**.

# Model Monitor

A production-style model monitoring and retraining system that simulates **real-world ML inference under drift**, tracks performance, triggers retraining, and safely promotes new models — all with clear separation of concerns and auditability.

This project is intentionally designed as a **portfolio-grade MLOps / Applied ML Engineering system**, not a toy demo.

---

## Why this project exists

Most ML demos stop at training a model.

Real systems must answer harder questions:

* What happens *after* deployment?
* How do we detect drift?
* When should we retrain?
* How do we promote models safely?
* How do we observe and audit decisions?

**Model Monitor** answers those questions end‑to‑end.

Each box is deliberately isolated. No layer “knows too much”.

---

## Core concepts

### 1. Predictor (inference layer)

* Loads the active production model
* Enforces feature schema strictly
* Computes:

  * accuracy
  * F1
  * confidence
  * drift score (PSI)
* Emits a **Decision** object per batch
* Writes metrics and prediction logs for auditability

The predictor is *stateful* only where necessary (cooldowns, batch index).

---

### 2. Decision Engine (policy layer)

The decision engine converts signals into actions:

* `none` – system healthy
* `retrain` – sustained performance degradation
* `reject` – severe feature drift

Rules are fully configurable via YAML.

Importantly:

> The decision engine contains **policy only**, not metrics computation.

---

### 3. Retrain Buffer

In production, labels arrive late.

The retrain buffer:

* Accumulates labeled batches
* Enforces a minimum sample threshold
* Produces a clean training dataframe when ready

This prevents noisy, premature retraining.

---

### 4. Retrain Pipeline

The retrain pipeline executes **exactly one retrain request**:

* Train candidate model
* Evaluate candidate vs current
* Decide promotion based on minimum F1 improvement
* Persist and promote via the model store

It does **not** decide *when* to retrain — that is handled upstream.

---

### 5. Model Store

The model store handles **all persistence concerns**:

* Active model loading
* Candidate saving
* Promotion
* Archiving old models with timestamps
* Writing promotion metadata for audit

This allows safe rollback and historical inspection.

---

### 6. Runtime orchestration

The orchestration loop (e.g. `run_simulation.py`) owns:

* Predictor lifecycle
* Retrain triggering
* Automatic model reload after promotion

This mirrors real streaming / batch systems.

```

---

## Running the system

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train an initial model

```bash
python training/train.py
```

### 3. Run the streaming simulation

```bash
python scripts/run_simulation.py
```

This will:

* Stream batches
* Detect drift
* Trigger retraining
* Promote models
* Reload predictor automatically

---

## Dashboard

A Streamlit dashboard is included:

```bash
streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
```

It displays:

* Service health
* Latest metrics
* Metric history over time

---

## Testing philosophy

This project uses **three layers of tests**:

1. Unit tests

   * Decision engine rules
   * Promotion logic

2. Inference tests

   * Golden path prediction
   * Failure paths (schema, missing model)

3. Integration tests

   * Retrain → promotion → reload lifecycle

Tests focus on *behavior*, not implementation details.

---

## What this project demonstrates

* Production ML thinking
* Clean architecture
* Explicit model lifecycle management
* Monitoring-driven retraining
* Auditability and reproducibility

This is the kind of system you build **after** your first real deployment.

---

## Future extensions (intentional)

* Async retraining workers
* Model rollback API
* SHAP-based explanations
* Feature-level drift dashboards
* Canary deployments

---

## Final note

This repository is designed to be **readable, realistic, and honest**.

There are no magic frameworks, no hidden globals, and no black boxes — just clear engineering decisions.

# Model Monitor (Datacheck)

A production‑style **model monitoring and retraining system** designed to look and feel like something you would actually ship.

This project focuses on:

* Detecting data drift and quality issues
* Deciding *when* retraining should happen
* Safely retraining and promoting models
* Keeping runtime prediction services stable

It is intentionally opinionated, pragmatic, and minimal — no toy abstractions, no academic fluff.

---

## Why this project exists

Most ML portfolios stop at:

* training a model
* evaluating it once
* saving it to disk

Real systems don’t fail because the model was bad — they fail because **nobody noticed it quietly becoming wrong**.

This project demonstrates:

* how monitoring feeds retraining
* how retraining feeds promotion
* how promotion safely feeds production

If you were hired to own an ML system long‑term, this is the part you’d actually be responsible for.

```

Key design choice:

> **Monitoring never directly retrains.**
> It only *requests* retraining.

---

## Core components

### Event ingestion

* Events represent real model inputs
* Validated before any monitoring logic runs
* Stored for drift analysis and retraining

Design goal: bad data should fail *fast* and *loud*.

---

### Drift & trust scoring

* PSI‑based distribution drift
* Feature‑level checks
* Aggregate trust score

This keeps decisions explainable:

> *“Retraining happened because feature X drifted by Y%.”*

---

### Retrain pipeline

The retrain pipeline is intentionally **dumb**.

It:

* trains a candidate model
* evaluates it
* compares against the current model
* promotes only if improvement is real

It does **not**:

* decide *when* to retrain
* know about events or queues

That separation keeps it testable and safe.

---

### Model promotion & storage

* Candidate models are stored separately
* Promotion is explicit and reversible
* No in‑place overwrites

This mirrors real production systems where rollback matters.

---

### Predictor runtime

The prediction service:

* loads the **current** model
* does not care about retraining
* can reload models without restarting

This prevents outages during promotion.

---

## Automatic predictor reload (design note)

The predictor watches the model store for changes:

* model version file
* symlink change
* metadata timestamp

On change:

* reloads the model into memory
* swaps references atomically

Why this matters:

* no service restart
* no dropped requests
* clean separation of concerns

---

## Testing strategy

This project focuses on **integration tests**, not just unit tests.

Why?

* Individual functions are simple
* Failure happens at boundaries

Covered scenarios:

* retraining with empty data
* promotion blocked on insufficient improvement
* promotion success path
* predictor reload after promotion

---

## What this project intentionally avoids

* AutoML
* Over‑engineering
* Abstract base classes everywhere
* "one framework to rule them all"

Everything here is explicit and debuggable.

---

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
python run_simulation.py
```

---

## What this demonstrates to employers

* You understand ML *systems*, not just models
* You know where real failures happen
* You design for safety, rollback, and observability
* You write code that looks maintainable

This is the kind of project that starts real technical conversations.

---

## Future extensions

* Shadow deployments
* Canary promotion
* Online performance metrics
* Feature attribution drift

The core architecture already supports these.

---

## Final note

This repo is not meant to be flashy.

It is meant to look like something that already survived its first on‑call rotation.
